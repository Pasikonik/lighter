# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# if User.where(admin: true).count == 0
#   a = User.first_or_create! do |a|
#     a.email = 'admin@z.com'
#     a.password = 'zapalnik123'
#     a.admin true
#   end
# end
